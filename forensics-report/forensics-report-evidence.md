# Forensics, Report & Presentation 

## Technical Scope: 
- Hashing, Autopsy case setup, 
- Autopsy hash verification, 
- Analysis, 
- hidden images discovery and recovery. 

### Tasks: 

1. Generate MD5 hash of an image file, store the hash in a file.
2. Create a new Autopsy case with the image in question, verify the hash with Autopsy. 
3. Verify that the hash in Autopsy matches the original hash taken.
4. Perform file analysis. Search & recover the 5 hidden JPG image files.
5. Analyze findings: explain why these artifacts are significant from a forensic perspective. 
6. Finalize VAPT report.
7. Work on the presentation deck.
